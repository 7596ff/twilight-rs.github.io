# Support

Support for the library is provided through the [GitHub issues] section and the
[Discord server].

If you have a question, then the issues or the server are both good fits for it.
If you find a bug, then the issues section is the best place.

The API documentation is [also available][api docs].

### Supported Rust Versions

Twilight supports Rust versions 1.39 and above.

### Breaking Changes

Although Twilight aims to design APIs right the first time, that obviously won't
happen. A lot of care is taken into designing them in an unopinionated way,
leaving more opinionated concepts to userland libraries.

While Twilight takes care to avoid the need for breaking changes, it will be
fearless when it needs to: they won't be avoided for the sake of avoiding a
change. Breaking changes won't be piled up over the course of a long time, so
when upgrades need to happen they will be quick and painless.
