# Building a Bot

In this chapter you'll learn what you need to create, compile, write, and run
your bot.

The guide assumes that have experience with Rust, and assumes that you are
caught up on its features, namely [async/await] support, which was introduced in
Rust 1.39. Also assumed is that you have [rustup] installed and understand the
basics on how to use it.

A minimal amount of experience with how Discord bots work is expected, but you
will be guided through how to create a bot user.
